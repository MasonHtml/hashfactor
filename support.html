                            <p class="fs-xl opacity-60">Basically permanent. However, if your account is inactive, miners will be deactivated after 2 years to save resources. In addition, free one-time mining power, which you receive once upon registration, may be deactivated after some time. However, mined Bitcoins will remain on your account permanently.</a></p>

                            <h3 class="fs-4xl">What limitations are there?</h3>
                            <p class="fs-xl opacity-60">There are no overall limits. However, the following applies per transaction or for individual purchases:
                                <br>The minimum purchase of Hardware Mining Power is 2.889 TH/s for 0.0004 BTC. <br>The maximum purchase of Hardware Mining Power is 40.957 PH/s for 3.5000 BTC.<br>
                                These restrictions are composed of restrictions on the Bitcoin network, in which low amounts can no longer be effectively utilized, as well as hardware limitations of our miners and the balance for fair hardware usage for all our customers. However, these limits only apply to individual purchases or Bitcoin transactions.</p>

                            <h3 class="fs-4xl">What are the additional costs or fees?</h3>
                            <p class="fs-xl opacity-60">Creating an account is always free of charge. However, there are minimal transaction fees for the purchase of hardware mining power. However, this is due to the Bitcoin technology and cannot be influenced by us! Purchases and setup fees at MineThrive are therefore always free of charge! For withdrawals, however, we have to charge a minimum fee to cover the Bitcoin transaction costs ourselves. They will be deducted directly from your balance. The advantage of this: You do not have to carry high Bitcoin network transactions yourself if the network has a high utilization (which sometimes happens). Our fees are permanently set at a fixed low amount to be able to send you your minings at any time. Except for transaction delays caused by the Bitcoin network, there are no delays. Hardware Mining Power allocation happens instantly.</p>
